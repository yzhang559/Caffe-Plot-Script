# Caffe-Plot-Script

#### Python scripts for plotting figure (accuracy vs. iterations / loss vs. iterations), for [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) users 

In training process, the console output (as figure below) can be saved as a text file.

Using the text file as input, run the plot script to obtain the curve graph:
